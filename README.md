# SouthernCaliforniaQmodel
The latest 1-D and 3-D seismic attenation (Q) models in Southern California crust will be uploaded after the study by Lin & Jordan (2023) is accepted to publish.

The file 1D_Qmodel_LJ18.txt is the 1-D seismic Q model in Southern California from surface (0 km) to 44 km depth.
This model is published in Lin, Y.-P. & Jordan, T. H. (2018). Frequency-Dependent Attenuation of P and S Waves in Southern California.
   J. Geophys. Res. Solid Earth, 123, 5814-5830, doi:10.1029/2018JB015448.

This is also the initial Q model in the study by Lin & Jordan (2023)
